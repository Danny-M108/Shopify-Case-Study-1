### When was the company incorporated?
Shopify was founded in 2004. 
### Who are the founders of the company?
Tobias Lutke and Scott Lake founded Shopify. 
### How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
After Tobias and Scott had a poor experience attempting to open Snowdevil, an online store for snowboarding equipment.  
  
Dissatisfied with the existing e-commerce products on the market, Tobias, a computer programmer by trade, instead built his own. Tobias used the open-source web application framework *Ruby on Rails* to build Snowdevil's online store and launched it after two months of development.  

The Snowdevil founders launched the platform as Shopify in June 2006.

Shopify has made “going online” simple, accessible, and functionally rich. Its customers can seamlessly receive online orders, receive payments (through a variety of direct and indirect channels) and fulfil orders through Amazon, Shopify or any transport\logistics company.

### What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
Shopify’s key advantage has been its commitment to innovation, technology leadership and leveraging strategic partnerships with organisations such Amazon, Facebook, Snapchat and Apple.  

The key differentiators of Shopify are its:  
  1. Ease of use – upwards from the novice online start-up.  
  2. Scalability in size and complexity of the commercial operations.  
  3. Use of innovative partnerships with organisations such as Amazon, Facebook, Alipay and Snapchat.

It has consistently pursued market leadership in the provision of a complete ecommerce eco system for online businesses of all sizes. 
An example of these advantage of this commitment include:  

•	In June 2009, Shopify launched an application programming interface (API) platform and App Store. The API allows developers to create applications for Shopify online and then    sell them on the Shopify App Store.
•	In April 2010, Shopify launched a free mobile app on the Apple App Store. The app lets Shopify store owners view and manage their stores from iOS mobile devices.  
•	In August 2013 announced the launch of an iPad-centric point of sale system. It uses an iPad to accept payments from debit and credit cards.  
•	In September 2015, Amazon.com announced it would be closing its Amazon Webstore service for merchants and had selected Shopify as the preferred migration provider.  
•	On October 3, 2016, Shopify acquired Boltmade. In November 2016, Shopify partnered with Paystack which allowed Nigerian online retailers to accept payments from                 customers around the world. On November 22, 2016, Shopify launched Frenzy, a mobile app that improves flash sales.  
•	In January 2017, Shopify announced integration with Amazon that would allow merchants to sell on Amazon from their Shopify stores.

The company has since released additional technology for brick-and-mortar retailers, including a point-of-sale system with a Dock and Retail Stand similar to that offered by Square, and a tappable chip card reader.  
•	On May 11, 2017, Shopify acquired Oberlo, which was one of the star applications on its own Shopify App Store. Oberlo connects Shopify merchants with suppliers who ship products directly to consumers and was acquired for $15M.  
•	In January 2019, Shopify announced the launch of Shopify Studios, a full-service television and film content and production house.

## Landscape:
### What domain of the financial industry is the company in?
Shopify is arguably the world leader in the ecommerce domain of the Fintech industry. 

### What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?  
Over the past decade, the evolution of both tech hardware and the internet has had a direct correlation with ecommerce. Just as the internet has grown into the desired medium for marketing, advertising, and purchasing of products, goods, and services; eCommerce has grown to rival traditional shopping in many ways.  

Preceded by tech giants like Amazon, who joined the space in 1995, and later Google and Paypal who launched their eCommerce initiatives in 1998.  The overall journey of online shopping is far from complete but it has undoubtedly accelerated in the last decade.  

The most impactful changes that have taken place in the eCommerce realm in the last 10 years, however, include:
1.	The rise of online marketplaces
2.	The seamless shift to using mobile devices for online shopping
3.	The tremendous growth of online and digital marketing and advertising.
4.	The practice of using digital modifications or enhancements to reality in sales and consumer shopping.

### What are the other major companies in this domain?
The *WebsiteBuilderExpert* site lists 7 top competitors to Shopify being:
1.	BigCommerce
2.	Volusion
3.	WooCommerce
4.	Wix
5.	Squarespace 
6.	Square Online
7.	Weebly  

“BigCommerce is Shopify’s biggest competitor due to its huge range of powerful sales features, while Volusion offers great analytics for tracking your store’s data. WooCommerce is self-hosted, which brings technical challenges but gives you more control. Wix is best for smaller businesses looking for greater creative freedom, but Squarespace has the most stunning designs. Square Online takes the cake for value, and Weebly is ideal for entrepreneurs.”

#### What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?  
In assessing key attributes or features of ecommerce platforms most comparisons are made based on:  
1. Price
2. Support
3. Payment processing fees and options
4. Ease of Entry
5. Features
6. Community Size

#### How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?
After surveying several different comparison sites Shopify is consistently ranked number one against these categories. 

However, an exception is *WebsiteBuilderExpert,* which ranked Wix the best ecommerce overall by a very slim margin however ranked Shopify as best for large commercial sites.

### Recommendations:
#### If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? 
My three key recommendations for Shopify is for it to provide:
  1.	Seamless trade finance. That is provide customers with the ability to purchase goods on credit and then provide factor finance once the goods are sold. Thus, reducing the       capital requirements for start-ups. 
  2.	Increase the solution to provide seamless Warehouse Management Services (WMS) and Transport Management Services (TMS). Currently this requires integration to third party         applications such as Cargo Wise and/or SmartFreight. 
  3.	Further to point 2 is for Shopify to provide enhance automation so an order once picked can be seamlessly managed from picking the order through to shipping, delivery           tracking and POD confirmation. 
  4.	Provide a blockchain/smart contract solution providing an alternative to using letters of credit, US dollars and the Swift payment system. A similar - but far more               complex enhancement - to one implemented in August 2013 when it released Shopify payments -which allowed merchants to accept credit cards without requiring a third-party         gateway. 
#### Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
The three ideas contained in the previous section would benefit the company by:
  1.	Increasing the ease and simplicity of becoming an on-line business through simplified financing requirements. 
  2.	Provide a seamless and automated stock management solution 
  3.	Facilitate easier international sales and trade by providing cheaper processes.  
#### What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
  1.	Technologies for an integrated WMS and TMS would be very similar to the technologies already deployed by Shopify. 
  2.	Providing trade finance would require similar technology to Shopify payments solutions however would probably require a partnership with a finance company or bank. 
  3.	A blockchain/smart contract solution to facilitate international trade would require a substantial and strategic investment in a block chain technology such as Cardano  and its Marlowe Playground.  
#### Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
The first two ideas are simply an extension and enhancement of the same technology and business services currently provided by Shopify. 
Cardano’s Marlow playground has been specifically designed to provide functionality in the financial services space. It is a third-generation proof-of-stake blockchain platform. Whilst not the only alternative for Shopify it would be a highly logical choice of technology for such an initiative.
